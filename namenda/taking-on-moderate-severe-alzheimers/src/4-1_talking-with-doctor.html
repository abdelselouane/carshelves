	<h3>Your Loved One, Your Doctor, and You &mdash; A Healthy Partnership</h3>
	<br />
	<h3>A Healthy Discussion Starts with Being Prepared</h3>
	<p>Whether your loved one was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease a few days ago or a few years ago, working with your doctor is an important part of successfully managing their treatment. Doctors who treat people with Alzheimer's disease rely on consistent, open communication with caregivers to help them get the best idea of how patients are doing on a daily basis.</p>
	<p>The more information you can gather before visits, the better prepared you will be to help the doctor provide the best care for your loved one. That's why it's important to have any questions or discussion points prepared ahead of your visit.</p>
	<p>Here are a few tools to help you have a better dialogue with your loved one's doctor during your next appointment.</p>
