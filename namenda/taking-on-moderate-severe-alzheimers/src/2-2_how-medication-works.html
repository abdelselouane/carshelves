	<h2>How NAMENDA&nbsp;XR&trade; Works</h2>
	<h3>How Does NAMENDA&nbsp;XR Work?</h3>
	<p class="intro">NAMENDA&nbsp;XR works in a different way than other Alzheimer's disease medications. That's why adding NAMENDA&nbsp;XR to an AChEI is effective &mdash; <strong>2 different treatments working 2 different ways to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.</strong></p>
	<div class="namenda-indication meds">
		<p>There are 2 types of medications that are approved to treat the symptoms of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Glutamate pathway modifiers<br /> (<strong>NAMENDA&nbsp;XR</strong>)</li>
			<li>Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (<strong>AChEIs</strong>) like ARICEPT<sup>&reg;</sup> (donepezil)*,<br /> RAZADYNE<sup>&reg;</sup> (galantamine)<sup>&dagger;</sup>, and <br />EXELON<sup>&reg;</sup> (rivastigmine)<sup>&Dagger;</sup> </li>
		</ul>

	<h3>What prescription drug treatments are available?</h3>
	<p>There are currently 2 types of prescription medications for Alzheimer's disease. These medications work differently to treat the symptoms of the disease. Often these medications are used together in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. </p>
	<ul class="big-margin">
		<li>One type of medication is thought to work by slowing the breakdown of a chemical in the brain called acetylcholine. This chemical is involved in learning and memory. This type of medication is called an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (or AChEI). Examples of this medication include ARICEPT<sup>&reg;</sup> (donepezil),* RAZADYNE<sup>&reg;</sup> (galantamine),<sup>&dagger;</sup> and EXELON<sup>&reg;</sup> (rivastigmine).<sup>&Dagger;</sup></li>
		<li>Another type of Alzheimer's disease medication may help regulate the abnormal activity of glutamate in the brain. Glutamate is another chemical in the brain that is important for learning and memory. NAMENDA&nbsp;XR is a once-a-day medication of this type approved for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, which can be used alone or added to ongoing AChEI therapy.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Because the 2 types of medication work in different ways, taking them together may be helpful &mdash; this is called combination therapy. </p>
	<div class="namenda-indication achei">
		<p><strong>There is no evidence that NAMENDA&nbsp;XR or an AChEI prevents or slows the underlying disease process in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</strong></p>
