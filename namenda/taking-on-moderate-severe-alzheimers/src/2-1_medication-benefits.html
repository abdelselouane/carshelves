	<h2>Why Add NAMENDA&nbsp;XR<sup>&trade;</sup>?</h2>
	<h3 class="sub1">The Benefits of NAMENDA&nbsp;XR and an AChEI</h3>
	<p><strong>If my loved one is taking an AChEI but the symptoms are still getting worse, what more can I do?</strong></p>
	<p>If the healthcare provider has prescribed only an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) for moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease, adding NAMENDA&nbsp;XR may help. In a clinical trial of patients taking AChEIs, adding NAMENDA&nbsp;XR produced benefits in mental function (also called cognition) and overall patient functioning (also called global function, which was based on the healthcare provider's assessment of the patient and interview with the caregiver).</p>

		<p><strong>There is no evidence that NAMENDA&nbsp;XR or an AChEI prevents or slows the underlying disease process in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</strong></p>

	<p>NAMENDA&nbsp;XR has been studied in patients already taking a stable dose of ARICEPT<sup>&reg;</sup> (donepezil 5-10 mg)*, RAZADYNE<sup>&reg;</sup> (8-24 mg)<sup>&dagger;</sup>, or EXELON<sup>&reg;</sup> (3-12 mg).<sup>&Dagger;</sup></p>
	<p>Once treatment is started, you may wonder how long it will take for the benefits of combination therapy with NAMENDA&nbsp;XR to have an effect. It's different for everyone.</p>
	<h3 class="sub2">What Can I Expect from Treatment with Once-a-Day NAMENDA&nbsp;XR?</h3>
	<p>Remember that it takes time for any treatment to begin working. When patients are treated with Alzheimer's disease medications, you may see one of the following. Symptoms will:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Progress more slowly</li>
		<li>Remain the same for a period of time</li>
		<li>Show some improvement for a period of time</li>
	</ul>
