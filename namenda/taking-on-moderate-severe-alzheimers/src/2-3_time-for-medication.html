	<h3 class="sub1">If your loved one is taking an AChEI for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and the symptoms are still getting worse, adding NAMENDA&nbsp;XR may help.</h3>
	<p>Once your loved one is <a href="diagnosis-treatment" onclick="return sl(this,'','embd-lnk_1');">diagnosed</a> it's important to monitor for any symptom changes, and <a href="talking-with-doctor" onclick="return sl(this,'','embd-lnk_2');">report those changes to your loved one's doctor</a>. A progression of symptoms may indicate that it's time to start treatment. People with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease may benefit from combination therapy with NAMENDA&nbsp;XR extended-release capsules and an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI).</p>

	<h3>How Does Alzheimer's Disease Progress?</h3>
	<p>The disease progresses at different rates in different people. Generally, patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease experience the fastest rate of decline. As a caregiver, you know the person you're caring for better than anyone. Tell the healthcare provider if you notice any changes in symptoms. As the disease progresses, the healthcare provider might talk about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease as occurring in moderate and severe stages.</p>
	<h3>Common Signs of Moderate Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Increased memory loss and confusion</li>
		<li>Problems recognizing family and friends</li>
		<li>Continuous repetition of stories, favorite words, or motions</li>
		<li>Difficulty carrying out tasks that have multiple steps, like getting dressed</li>
		<li>Lack of concern for hygiene and appearance</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Common Signs of Severe Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Inability to recognize oneself or family</li>
		<li>Inability to communicate</li>
		<li>Lack of control of bowel and bladder</li>
		<li>Groaning, moaning, or grunting</li>
		<li>Needing help with all activities of daily living </li>
	</ul>

	<p>If the healthcare provider has prescribed only an AChEI for moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease, adding NAMENDA&nbsp;XR may help.</p>
	<p>In a clinical trial of patients taking AChEIs, adding NAMENDA&nbsp;XR produced benefits in mental function (also called cognition) and overall patient functioning (also called global function, which was based on the healthcare provider's assessment of the patient and interview with the caregiver). </p>
	<p>NAMENDA&nbsp;XR has been studied in patients already taking a stable dose of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">donepezil&nbsp;(5-10&nbsp;mg),</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">galantamine&nbsp;(8-24&nbsp;mg),</span> or <span style="white-space:nowrap;">rivastigmine&nbsp;(3-12&nbsp;mg).</span> </p>
<div class="namenda-indication achei">
		<p><strong>There is no evidence that NAMENDA&nbsp;XR or an AChEI prevents or slows the underlying disease process in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</strong></p>

	<div class="callout-tip">
		<h3>Caregiver Tip:</h3>
		<p>If your loved one has been diagnosed with moderate Alzheimer's disease and symptoms have progressed since diagnosis, ask the doctor about adding NAMENDA&nbsp;XR to an AChEI. If your loved one has started an AChEI, <strong>ask about re-evaluating your loved one's treatment regimen in about 3 months.</strong></p>
