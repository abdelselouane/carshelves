	<h3 class="sub1">What If My Loved One Is Already Taking NAMENDA<sup>&reg;</sup> (memantine&nbsp;hydrochloride) Twice a Day?</h3>
	<p>If your loved one is currently taking twice-a-day NAMENDA, talk to your healthcare provider about how to switch to once-a-day NAMENDA&nbsp;XR<sup>&trade;</sup> (memantine hydrochloride). Most patients already taking NAMENDA tablets twice a day can start taking NAMENDA&nbsp;XR capsules (the extended-release form), once a day, the very next day.</p>

	<h3 class="sub2">What If My Loved One Has Never Taken NAMENDA?</h3>

It contains a 4-week supply of color-coded NAMENDA&nbsp;XR capsules (7&nbsp;mg, 14&nbsp;mg, 21&nbsp;mg, and 28&nbsp;mg) to be sure that your loved one is taking the right dose while getting started.</p>

	<p>NAMENDA&nbsp;XR should be taken every day. It can be taken with or without food at any time of the day.<br />
	NAMENDA&nbsp;XR capsules should be swallowed whole. They should not be divided, crushed, or chewed.<br />
