									<h3>How Are IBS-C and CIC Typically Treated?</h3>
									<div class="header-bg"></div>
									<p>There is no cure for IBS-C or CIC, but there are ways to help cope with symptoms.</p>
									<h4>Make Changes to Your Diet.</h4>
									<p>Fiber in your diet may help create softer stools that are easier to pass. Foods high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, beans, and bran flakes. For people suffering from IBS-C, certain foods are commonly known to worsen symptoms, including fatty foods, alcohol, and caffeinated drinks like coffee or soda. These types of foods should be avoided. Also, eating large meals can sometimes trigger symptoms. Having smaller portions or smaller meals more often may help.</p>
									<h4 class="seperator">Drink Plenty of Water.</h4>
									<p>About 6-8 glasses of water per day are important to stay hydrated.</p>
									<h4 class="seperator">More Exercise, Less Stress.</h4>
									<p>Increased exercise and stress reduction have also been shown to help relieve symptoms. Learning relaxation techniques may help in stressful situations, and increasing exercise like walking and yoga may also be helpful. Please check with your doctor before changing your diet or starting an exercise program.</p>
									<p>In addition to diet and exercise, OTC laxatives and stool softeners are approved to treat occasional constipation. However, these products are not intended for long-term treatment of constipation without the supervision of a physician and they are not FDA approved for the treatment of IBS-C.</p>
									<p>There are also a limited number of prescription treatments available that are FDA approved for CIC, IBS-C or both.</p>
									<h4 class="seperator">LINZESS Is a Prescription Option.</h4>
									<p>There's a prescription treatment option called LINZESS<sup>&trade;</sup> (linaclotide) that helps you <strong><a href="how-treatment-works.html" alt="How treatment works?">proactively manage your symptoms of IBS-C or CIC</a></strong>.</p>
									<p><strong>Talk to your doctor about your symptoms and see if LINZESS is right for you.</strong></p>
									<p>LINZESS is a prescription medication used in adults to treat IBS-C and CIC. "Idiopathic" means the cause of the constipation is unknown. <strong>It is not known if LINZESS is safe and effective in children.</strong></p>
									<p>LINZESS is not a laxative. It is a once-daily capsule approved to help relieve the abdominal pain and constipation of IBS-C, and the symptoms of CIC, including hard and infrequent stools, and incomplete bowel movements.</p>
									<p>Please see <strong><a href="#isi" alt="Important Risk Information" >Important Risk Information</a></strong> about LINZESS.</p>
